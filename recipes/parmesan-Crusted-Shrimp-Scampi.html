    <h2>Steps</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <li>
            Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook angel hair pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
            until tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain and set aside.
        </li>
        
        <h4>Step 2</h4>

        <li>
            Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        
        <li>
            Heat 1/4 cup butter over medium heat in a large, deep skillet.
            Add garlic; cook and stir until fragrant. Add shrimp, white wine, and lemon juice;
            continue to cook and stir until shrimp is bright pink on the outside and the meat is opaque, about 5 minutes.
            Stir in red pepper flakes until well combined. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        
        <li>
            Place remaining 1/4 cup butter, bread crumbs, 1/2 the Parmesan cheese, and parsley in a bowl.
            Stir until well combined. Set aside.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 5</h4>

        <li>
            Place cooked pasta into shrimp scampi mixture; toss until fully coated in sauce.
             Add remaining Parmesan cheese and toss well. Top with bread crumb mixture.
        </li>

        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        
        <li>
            Broil in the preheated oven until golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Serve immediately.
        </li>
